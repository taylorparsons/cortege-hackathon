# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to:

- **Email:** [security@yourcompany.com](mailto:security@yourcompany.com)
- **Security Advisory:** Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description** - Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact** - Potential impact and severity assessment
3. **Steps to Reproduce** - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept** - Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue
5. **Suggested Fix** - If you have recommendations for fixing the issue
6. **Your Contact Information** - So we can follow up with questions

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline:** Depends on severity (see below)

| Severity | Response Time | Fix Timeline |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Critical | Immediate | 24-48 hours |
| High | 24 hours | 1 week |
| Medium | 48 hours | 2-4 weeks |
| Low | 1 week | As resources permit |

## Supported Versions

We release security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Update Process

### When We Release Security Updates

1. **Vulnerability Confirmed** - We verify the security issue
2. **Fix Developed** - We develop and test a fix
3. **Security Advisory** - We publish a GitHub Security Advisory
4. **Patch Released** - We release a patch version
5. **Public Disclosure** - After users have time to update (typically 1 week)

### Notification

Security updates are announced through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes (marked with 🔒)
- Email notifications (if you're watching the repository)
- [Security mailing list](mailto:security-announce@yourcompany.com) (subscribe link)

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Before Committing Code

1. **Run Security Scan**
   ```bash
   python git-workflow-automation/scripts/scan_for_secrets.py --staged
   ```

2. **Check for Vulnerabilities**
   ```bash
   python git-workflow-automation/scripts/audit_repository_security.py --quick
   ```

3. **Never Commit Secrets**
   - No API keys, passwords, tokens
   - Use environment variables
   - Add sensitive files to `.gitignore`

### Code Security Guidelines

#### ✅ DO

- Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Enable MFA/2FA on your GitHub account
- Sign your commits with GPG

#### ❌ DON'T

- Hardcode secrets or credentials
- Use `eval()` or similar dangerous functions
- Trust user input without validation
- Commit `.env` files or config with secrets
- Use deprecated or unmaintained dependencies
- Disable security features

### Dependency Security

- **Update regularly:** Run `npm audit` / `pip check` monthly
- **Review changes:** Check changelogs before updating
- **Use lock files:** Commit `package-lock.json` / `requirements.txt`
- **Enable Dependabot:** Automated dependency updates
- **Pin versions:** In production, use exact versions

## Common Vulnerabilities

### OWASP Top 10 Prevention

We actively protect against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:

1. **Injection** - Use parameterized queries, input validation
2. **Broken Authentication** - Use established auth libraries, MFA
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Encrypt data, use HTTPS, never log secrets
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)** - Disable XML external entity processing
5. **Broken Access Control** - Implement proper authorization checks
6. **Security Misconfiguration** - Secure defaults, minimal attack surface
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Sanitize outputs, use CSP headers
8. **Insecure Deserialization** - Validate serialized data, use safe formats
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities** - Keep dependencies updated
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring** - Log security events, monitor alerts

## Responsible Disclosure

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- We will keep you informed about our progress
- We will credit you in release notes (if desired)
- We will notify you when the vulnerability is fixed

### What We Ask

- Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure
- Act in good faith - don't access or modify data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Don't perform attacks that could harm availability (DDoS, etc.)

### Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:

- Credited in release notes (if desired)
- Listed in our security hall of fame
- Eligible for bug bounty (if program is active)
