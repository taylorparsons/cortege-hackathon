Request (verbatim):
use the superpowers to brain storm on how create the group of agents that will run based on events and timing that will report back and a central orchestrator to interact with the user to assure that the account is protected. read the documentation to get the scope and offer options and of course work with Athena

Notes:
- User wants to design the companion agent system from the GUARDIAN PRD v2
- Agents should be event-driven and time-driven with a central orchestrator
- Must support hackathon participants creating new agents from a pattern
- Twilio integration for real inbound calls (account exists, plug in later)
- Demo should show agents learning over time
- Scope narrowed to: architecture design + lightweight PoC, one fully working agent, agent factory pattern for extensibility
